#  Titanic Survival Classification

## Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning classification task based on the famous Titanic dataset.  
The objective is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, etc.

## Objective
To build a classification model that predicts passenger survival using Logistic Regression.

##  Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset contains passenger details such as:
- PassengerId
- Pclass (Ticket class)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)
- Parch (Parents/Children aboard)
- Fare
- Embarked
- Survived (Target Variable)

Target Variable:
- 0 = Did not survive
- 1 = Survived

## Project Workflow

1. Importing libraries  
2. Data loading  
3. Data cleaning (handling missing values)  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Encoding categorical variables  
6. Splitting dataset into training and testing sets  
7. Model training using Logistic Regression  
8. Model evaluation using accuracy score  


##  Model Used
Logistic Regression (from Scikit-learn)

##  Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using:

- Accuracy Score

The accuracy score shows how correctly the model predicts survival.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

3. Run all cells step by step.


##  Results
The Logistic Regression model successfully predicts survival with good accuracy.
